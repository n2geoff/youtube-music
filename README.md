# YouTube Music Player

Simple [electron]() application wrapper around [YouTube Music](https://music.youtube.com/), so you don't have to lose yet another tab to a background process, and tray apps are cool;)

If you just want to listen to music, grab the latest [RELEASE]()

Otherwise...

    npm install

    npm start

New files will be in `.build/YouTube Music-win32-x64/`, however if you want to create the installer then run

    npm run install

this will build and create the installer, currently, under `.build/windows-installer/`

> Windows Only!

## Todo

- Application Signing
